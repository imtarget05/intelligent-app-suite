EXAMPLE_1 = """=== Example 1 — retrieval hallucination (P01 style) ===

Context:
You have a simple RAG chatbot that answers questions from a product FAQ.
The FAQ only covers billing rules for your SaaS product and does NOT mention anything about cryptocurrency.

User prompt:
"Can I pay my subscription with Bitcoin?"

Retrieved context (from vector store):
- "We only accept major credit cards and PayPal."
- "All payments are processed in USD."

Model answer:
"Yes, you can pay with Bitcoin. We support several cryptocurrencies through a third-party payment gateway."

Logs:
No errors. Retrieval shows the FAQ chunks above, but the model still confidently invents Bitcoin support.
"""


EXAMPLE_2 = """=== Example 2 — startup ordering / dependency not ready (P10 style) ===

Context:
You have a RAG API with three services: api-gateway, rag-worker, and vector-db (for example Qdrant or FAISS).
In local docker compose everything works.

Deployment:
In production, services are deployed on Kubernetes.

Symptom:
Right after a fresh deploy, api-gateway returns 500 errors for the first few minutes.
Logs show connection timeouts from api-gateway to vector-db.

After a few minutes, the errors disappear and the system behaves normally.
You suspect a startup race between api-gateway and vector-db but are not sure how to fix it properly.
"""


EXAMPLE_3 = """=== Example 3 — config or secrets drift (P11 style) ===

Context:
You added a new environment variable for the RAG pipeline: SECRET_RAG_KEY.
This is required by middleware that signs outgoing requests to an internal search API.

Local:
On developer machines, SECRET_RAG_KEY is defined in .env and everything works.

Production:
You deployed a new version but forgot to add SECRET_RAG_KEY to the production environment.
The first requests after deploy fail with 500 errors and "missing secret" messages in the logs.

After hot-patching the secret into production, the errors stop.
However, similar "first deploy breaks because of missing config" incidents keep happening.

You are an assistant that triages failures in LLM + RAG pipelines.

You have a library of reusable failure patterns P01–P12.
For each bug description, you must:

1. Choose exactly ONE primary pattern id from P01–P12.
2. Optionally choose up to TWO secondary candidate pattern ids.
3. Explain your reasoning in clear bullet points.
4. Propose a MINIMAL structural fix:
   - changes to retrieval, indexing, routing, evaluation, tooling, or infra
   - avoid generic advice like "add more context" or "use a better model"

You are not allowed to invent new pattern ids.
Always select from the patterns listed below.

Return your answer as structured Markdown with the following sections:

- Primary pattern
- Secondary candidates (optional)
- Reasoning
- Minimal structural fix
